Attach Explosives

I've been holding onto this one for a while, but after seeing all the whining and complaining here on the forums about not being able to breach bases without insane amounts of explosives, I've decided to release this.  This is not my original work, but it has been modified by second_coming and myself to work for Epoch.  

The problem with explosives currently is that it takes way too many of them to do any real damage to structures.  The reason is that with stock Arma, when you place an explosives charge it is placed on the ground in front of the object.  When the explosive goes off most of the explosive force is driven into the ground.  Damage of the objects nearby is limited to splash damage only, which is only a fraction of the damage that can potentially be dealt by the explosive.  

So, to solve this, you can use this script to attach the explosive charge directly to the object you are wanting to demolish, thereby greatly reducing the amount of explosives it takes to accomplish the desired effect.  With the traditional placement method of setting a charge on the ground in front of an object, it can take up to 30 charges to breach a door.   By attaching the explosive directly to the door, we can now have the same damage, using only 3 or 4 charges.

The explosives can be attached to any object you specify within the script.  You can set it to work with only Epoch buildables, or you can also include vehicles, as I have done in the download.  This makes for some interesting scenarios where people can set traps for others by attaching a charge to their vehicles and then detonating them remotely to either create a distraction or also to destroy a vehicle with a target player inside.  The possibilities are endless and can provide for some exciting gameplay, in addition to making base raiding more realistic and fun.
